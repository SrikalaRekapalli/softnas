## Introduction: Using DgSecure in the Hortonworks Sandbox


This document will guide you through several use cases around Discovering and protecting sensitive data within a SQL Server database.    DBAs nowadays are no longer involved in the cradle-to-grave life cycle of databases.  They are now separate departments that maintain hundreds of databases and are no longer familiar with every database, every table and every column.  The need to now protect sensitive data within those databases for test/dev users becomes harder and harder without DBAs being tightly involved day after day.  Dataguise’s DgSecure for DBMS will show you how to find all of your sensitive data within these databases and then (with that Discovery knowledge), now confidently mask these copies this protecting your organization from insider breaches.  


This Guide will step you through the DgSecure interface and how to successfully protect your company’s sensitive data and now confidently utilize the cloud for your testing and developing of applications.   This guide will utilize the SQL Server AdventureWorks database which is hidden behind the scenes during this evaluation.
