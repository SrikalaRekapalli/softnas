##Introduction

The goal of this Test Drive is to allow you to become more familiar with SoftNAS Cloud® on
Microsoft Azure®. In this test drive of SoftNAS Cloud, we have made it easy for you to view
and try SoftNAS Cloud features and to discover the ease of configuring common storage
protocols within the SoftNAS Cloud user interface (UI).
To do this, we’ve provided you with a SoftNAS Cloud Virtual Machine (VM) hosted on Azure.
We’ve preconfigured a single disk, storage pool and volume which is provisioned as an NFS
export, CIFS share, iSCSI LUN and Apple File Protocol (AFP) share. This configuration could
easily be extended, simply by adding more disks, volumes and pools, to serve an
organization’s application and end-user services. SoftNAS Cloud’s flexibility allows us to
meet a customer’s requirements simply by changing the properties of compute and
storage capacity. The end result of such a configuration looks similar to the image below:
(please refer image softnas-cloud)
SoftNAS Cloud extends native file storage capacities on Microsoft Azure, providing an
enterprise-class NAS filer virtual storage appliance that scale to petabytes with highavailability
and is backed by the No Storage Downtime Guarantee.
