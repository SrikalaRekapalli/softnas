###Enterprise NAS Features –The commercial-grade features previously only found on
cumbersome, expensive NAS appliances are now available to you as a robust software  solution – regardless of company size and budget.

###Azure Blob Object Storage Support – SoftNAS Cloud® frontends the object-based scalable
storage, provided by Azure Blob Storage, by presenting it as NFS, CIFS/SMB, iSCSI or AFP file sharing protocols for business applications and workloads. SoftNAS Cloud allows easy
application and workload migrations to the Azure cloud without the requirement for changing your existing application data structures or workflows. SoftNAS Cloud allows you
to scale your NAS deployments using Azure Blob Storage from gigabytes to multi-petabytes.

###SNAP HA™ – now on Azure – SoftNAS’ patent-pending SNAP HA™ allows easy highavailability
(HA) and cluster configurations for robust, non-stop application operation with automatic failover and seamless transfer across controllers. SNAP HA, combined with Azure
availability sets, makes the unique SoftNAS No Storage Downtime Guarantee available for customers using SoftNAS Cloud for Microsoft Azure.

###DeltaSync™ – Reduces the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) from days to hours for cluster
recovery, from a high-availability (HA) failover event.

###Role-based Access Control (RBAC) – Ensure greater security and control for organizations
with multiple users or systems on Microsoft Azure. RBAC allows management of users, roles and permissions to provide defined parameters for delegated administration.

###Low Cost – SoftNAS Cloud® is a low cost, flexible NAS software solution, affordable enough
for any small to medium-sized business, yet powerful enough to scale to very large enterprise requirements. With Azure Blob support, there is no need to purchase larger
instance sizes, if your primary need is additional storage!

###No Training Needed – SoftNAS Cloud makes it easy to get started without the need for timeconsuming
and expensive training courses. The SoftNAS Knowledge base (KB) and helpdesk resources are available from day one.
